`swrv` (pronounced "swerve") is a library using
[@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) hooks for
remote data fetching. It is largely a port of
[swr](https://github.com/zeit/swr).

The name “SWR” is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a cache invalidation
strategy popularized by HTTP [RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861).
SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request
(revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

Features:

- [x] Transport and protocol agnostic data fetching
- [x] Fast page navigation
- [x] Revalidation on focus
- [x] Interval polling
- [x] Request deduplication
- [x] TypeScript ready
- [x] Minimal API

With `swrv`, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and
automatically. Thus, the UI will be always fast and reactive.

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add swrv
```

## Getting Started

```vue
<template>
  <div v-if="error">failed to load</div>
  <div v-if="!data">loading...</div>
  <div v-else>hello {{ data.name }}</div>
</template>

<script>
import useSWRV from 'swrv'

export default {
  name: 'Profile',

  setup() {
    const { data, error } = useSWRV('/api/user', fetcher)

    return {
      data,
      error
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

In this example, the Vue Hook `useSWRV` accepts a `key` and a `fetcher`
function. `key` is a unique identifier of the request, normally the URL of the
API. And the fetcher accepts key as its parameter and returns the data
asynchronously.

`useSWR` also returns 2 values: `data` and `error`. When the request (fetcher)
is not yet finished, data will be `undefined`. And when we get a response, it
sets `data` and `error` based on the result of fetcher and rerenders the
component. This is because `data` and `error` are Vue
[Refs](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/#detailed-design), and have
dependencies on the fetcher response.

Note that fetcher can be any asynchronous function, so you can use your favorite
data-fetching library to handle that part.

## Api

```ts
const { data, error } = useSWRV(key, fetcher, options)
```

### Parameters

| Param     | Required | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`     | yes      | a unique key string for the request (or a function / array / null) (advanced usage) |
| `fetcher` | yes      | a Promise returning function to fetch your data (details)                           |
| `options` |          | an object of configuration options                                                  |

### Return Values

- `data`: data for the given key resolved by fetcher (or undefined if not
  loaded)
- `error`: error thrown by fetcher (or undefined)

### Config options

- `refreshInterval = 0` - polling interval in milliseconds
- `dedupingInterval = 2000` - dedupe requests with the same key in this time
  span
- `ttl = 0` - time to live of response data in cache

## Prefetching

Prefetching can be useful for when you anticipate user actions, like hovering
over a link. SWRV exposes the `mutate` function so that results can be stored in
the SWRV cache at a predetermined time.

```ts
import { mutate } from 'swrv'

function prefetch() {
  mutate(
    '/api/data',
    fetch('/api/data').then(res => res.json())
  )
  // the second parameter is a Promise
  // SWRV will use the result when it resolves
}
```
