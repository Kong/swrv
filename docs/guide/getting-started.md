## Overview

`swrv` (pronounced "swerve") is a library using
[@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) hooks for
remote data fetching. It is largely a port of
[swr](https://github.com/zeit/swr).

The name ‚ÄúSWR‚Äù is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a cache invalidation
strategy popularized by HTTP [RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861).
SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request
(revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

## Features

- üì° Transport and protocol agnostic data fetching
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast page navigation
- ‚è≤ Interval polling
- üñ• SSR support
- üññ Vue 3 Support
- Revalidation on focus
- Request deduplication
- TypeScript ready
- Minimal API
- Stale-if-error
- Customizable cache implementation
- Error Retry

With `swrv`, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and
automatically. Thus, the UI will be always fast and reactive.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add swrv
```

If you want to try out Vue 3 support, install the beta release and
check out the [Vite example](https://github.com/Kong/swrv/tree/next/examples/vite).
`swrv` code for Vue 3.0 exists on `next` branch.

```shell
yarn add swrv@beta
```

## Usage

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="error">failed to load</div>
    <div v-if="!data">loading...</div>
    <div v-else>hello {{ data.name }}</div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import useSWRV from 'swrv'

export default {
  setup() {
    const { data, error } = useSWRV('/api/user', fetcher)

    return {
      data,
      error
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

In this example, the Vue Hook `useSWRV` accepts a `key` and a `fetcher`
function. `key` is a unique identifier of the request, normally the URL of the
API. And the fetcher accepts key as its parameter and returns the data
asynchronously.

`useSWRV` also returns 2 values: `data` and `error`. When the request (fetcher)
is not yet finished, data will be `undefined`. And when we get a response, it
sets `data` and `error` based on the result of fetcher and rerenders the
component. This is because `data` and `error` are Vue
[Refs](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/#detailed-design), and their
values will be set by the fetcher response.

Note that fetcher can be any asynchronous function, so you can use your favorite
data-fetching library to handle that part. When omitted, swrv falls back to the 
browser [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
